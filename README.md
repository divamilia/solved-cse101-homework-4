Write a program in C language. The program will read and write file and fill a structure type. The file contains disorganized details about people. You should read properly for every person’s detail, and write properly. And you have to write a file like that:

<table width="578">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="236">ID                NAME</td>

   <td width="189">SIR NAME</td>

   <td width="153">MAIL</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="236">05122018    Ozgu</td>

   <td width="189"> GOKSU</td>

   <td width="153"><u><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a7c8c0c8ccd4d2e7c0d3d289c2c3d289d3d5">[email protected]</a></u></td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

<ul>

 <li>You should use functions for every purpose. For example; readDataFromFile(records, FILE *fp), writeDataToFile(records, FILE *fp), etc where records is a pointer to array of structures.</li>

 <li>You should use structure which contains name, sir name, ID, e-mail.</li>

 <li>You should put all details about people in structures.</li>

 <li>You can use “hw4_disordered_people.txt” as a file to read.</li>

 <li>You should create a new ordered file.</li>

 <li>You have to send ordered file in zip directory.</li>

</ul>

Upload your files (main.c, orderedFile.txt, ..) in a .zip or .rar file on moodle. The zip name should be in the same in the form of : number_name_surname (ex:181041001_ozgu_goksu.zip).
